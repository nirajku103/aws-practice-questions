1. What is AWS X-Ray?

AWS X-Ray is a service that helps you analyze and debug distributed applications by tracing requests as they travel through your AWS infrastructure.

2. Why should I use AWS X-Ray?

X-Ray helps in debugging and tracing performance issues in distributed applications, providing end-to-end visibility across microservices.

3. What is a trace in AWS X-Ray?

A trace is a collection of segments that represent a single request or transaction as it moves through various services in your application.

4. How does AWS X-Ray help with debugging?

X-Ray provides visual representations of request flows, error rates, and latency, helping you identify bottlenecks and failures in your application.

5. How does AWS X-Ray work with AWS Lambda?

X-Ray integrates with Lambda functions to trace incoming requests and outbound API calls, giving you visibility into function execution.

6. What is a segment in AWS X-Ray?

A segment represents a unit of work done by a service or resource in your application (like an HTTP request, database call, etc.).

7. Can AWS X-Ray trace requests across AWS accounts?

Yes, you can configure AWS X-Ray to trace requests across multiple AWS accounts by setting up the appropriate permissions.

8. How can I visualize traces in AWS X-Ray?

You can visualize traces and analyze request performance using the AWS X-Ray Console, where you can view trace maps, error rates, and latencies.

9. What are sampling rules in AWS X-Ray?

Sampling rules allow you to control which requests get traced. It helps reduce the volume of trace data generated for high-traffic applications.

10. How to set up AWS X-Ray for my application?

Install the AWS X-Ray SDK for your application.

Enable X-Ray tracing for AWS Lambda or other AWS services.

Configure sampling rules and permissions.

11. What are common issues during setup?

Missing IAM permissions for the X-Ray service role.

Incorrect sampling rules.

Incomplete integration with application code.

12. What are best practices for using X-Ray?

Enable X-Ray only for production workloads.

Use sampling rules to control trace volume.

Analyze traces regularly to identify performance bottlenecks.
