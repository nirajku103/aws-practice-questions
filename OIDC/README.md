1. What is an OIDC identity provider in AWS IAM?

An OIDC (OpenID Connect) identity provider in AWS IAM allows you to authenticate users from external identity providers (like Google, Facebook, or any other provider supporting OIDC). It enables federated access to AWS resources without creating IAM users.

2. How do you create an OIDC identity provider in AWS IAM?

You can create an OIDC identity provider in IAM by specifying the OIDC issuer URL and the client ID. The identity provider can then be used for federated authentication.

AWS CLI Command:

aws iam create-open-id-connect-provider \
    --url https://accounts.google.com \
    --client-id-list "my-client-id" \
    --thumbprint-list "THUMBPRINT_VALUE"

Terraform Resource Block:

resource "aws_iam_openid_connect_provider" "my_oidc_provider" {
  url               = "https://accounts.google.com"
  client_id_list    = ["my-client-id"]
  thumbprint_list   = ["THUMBPRINT_VALUE"]
}

3. What are the prerequisites for creating an OIDC identity provider in AWS IAM?

You must have the OIDC issuer URL.

You must have the client ID and client secret from the OIDC provider.

You need the thumbprint of the provider's public certificate.

4. How do you manage an OIDC identity provider using AWS CLI?

Once you have an OIDC identity provider, you can manage it using AWS CLI commands like update, delete, and list.

Example AWS CLI Commands:

List OIDC providers:

aws iam list-open-id-connect-providers
Delete an OIDC identity provider:

aws iam delete-open-id-connect-provider --open-id-connect-provider-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/accounts.google.com

5. What is the role of IAM policies in OIDC federation?

IAM policies grant permission to federated users (authenticated via OIDC) to access AWS resources. You attach policies to IAM roles that federated users can assume.

6. Can you provide a Terraform resource block example for creating an OIDC identity provider?

Yes, here’s an example Terraform resource for creating an OIDC identity provider:

resource "aws_iam_openid_connect_provider" "my_oidc_provider" {
  url               = "https://accounts.google.com"
  client_id_list    = ["my-client-id"]
  thumbprint_list   = ["THUMBPRINT_VALUE"]
}

7. What are the security considerations when using OIDC identity providers in AWS?

Ensure that only trusted OIDC providers are used.

Use role-based access control (RBAC) in your IAM policies.

Regularly rotate the client secret and thumbprints.

8. How do you troubleshoot common issues with OIDC federation in AWS?

Verify the OIDC issuer URL and client ID.


Ensure that the thumbprint is correctly configured.

Check IAM role trust policies for permission issues.

Monitor CloudTrail for authentication failures.

9. How do you update an existing OIDC identity provider in AWS IAM?

To update the OIDC identity provider, you can modify the provider’s settings such as the client ID or thumbprint.

AWS CLI Command:

aws iam update-open-id-connect-provider \
    --open-id-connect-provider-arn arn:aws:iam::123456789012:oidc-provider/accounts.google.com \
    --client-id-list "new-client-id"
